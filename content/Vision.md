Vision has become a buzzword in recent years, due to the rise in popularity of “leadership” philosophies, specifically in business. **Business** definitions (popularized by gurus like John Maxwell, Peter Drucker, and Tom Peters) can largely be summarized as “An evolving dream that you persuade other people to share with you.”[^1] 

**Biblically**, the term is almost always used to describe an encounter with God where He imparts special revelation through audio-visual experiences, whether intuitively or in dreams. He often speaks directly to prophets, who then communicate the vision received from God to Israel.

In a more literal, simple sense the term “vision” generally revolves around “the act of seeing something”. How should we think about “vision” as believers in Jesus? And what is the “vision” of the Village as a church community?

Our working definition for “vision” is this: “What God wants His church to aspire to, based on what we have seen and heard from Jesus.”

We believe this vision is summarized in the three commandments below, each directly from the mouth of Jesus. According to Him, the first two commandments are what “all the Law and the Prophets hang upon.” The last was his final command to his disciples before His ascension to the right hand of the throne of God. Each command has other support texts cited as well.

### Vision Statements

1. **“The LORD is our God, the LORD is one; You shall love the LORD your God with all of your heart, all of your soul, all of your mind, and all of your strength.”**[^2]
   
2. **“You shall love your neighbor as yourself.”**[^3]
   
3. **“Go, and make disciples of all the nations, baptizing them in the name of the Father and the Son and the Holy Spirit, teaching them to follow all that I commanded you.”**[^4]

In all that we do as a church, we seek to obey these three commands and fulfill Jesus’ vision for His church. These commands overlay one another and do not exist independently. To fail to love our neighbors is to fail to love God.[^5] To fail to make disciples is to fail to love God.[^6] As discussed elsewhere, [[Strategies]] may adjust for a variety of factors, but the ultimate aim in all we do is motivated and guided by these three commands. Succinctly put, the Village exists to **Love the LORD our God**, to **love our neighbors**, and to **make disciples of all nations**.
