A strategy can be defined as a “plan of action designed to achieve a major objective.” Replacing ‘major objective’ with ‘God’s [[Vision]]’ gives us a good working definition for strategies: 

**“Plans of action designed to achieve God’s vision.”**

These strategic distinctives are secondary to God’s vision for His people. They can and should be revisited and adjusted as needed. These strategies differ from other churches, which is expected. Churches operating in America, where Christianity is widely accepted, will organize differently than underground house churches in China. Timeless principles such as the "One Anothers", along with the example of the early church in Acts, guide our decisions in these areas.
