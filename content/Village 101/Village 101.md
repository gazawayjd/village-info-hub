The Village exists to fulfill the commands of Jesus to **love God, love neighbor, and make disciples.** We are committed to living out the teachings of Jesus within the context of organic, genuine community within "house churches". We have prepared this series of documents/pages to give resources and direction to those looking to learn more and join in what God is doing through our community. Each link below goes to a page that explains various terms and concepts in greater depth for those interested. There are two sections below: Vision/Strategies & Meeting Rhythms

Our vision is summarized in the three commands listed above, while our strategies are aimed at fulfilling this vision. These strategic distinctives connect to each vision statement, lest we move away from Jesus' vision for His church, and should adjust as needed. For a little more detail on these terms, see the [[Vision]] and [[Strategies]] pages. 

The [[Meeting Rhythms]] page gives a quick snapshot of how we're operating currently.

This document is currently a work in progress, so please let Jason Gazaway (gazawayjd@gmail.com) know if you see any errors or have suggestions on clarifications/improvements. You can also check out www.thevillageocn.com to find more information or set up giving.
